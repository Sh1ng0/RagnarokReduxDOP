Performance Breakdown of a Basic Attack
Here is a step-by-step analysis of the entire loop:

1. Input & Command Creation (Client-Side) üñ±Ô∏è
   Action: The player clicks on a monster. The Swing/JavaFX event loop captures this instantly. Your client code creates a small command object, like new AttackCommand(monsterId).

Performance: Nanoseconds. This is a local operation and is virtually free.

2. Command Transmission (Client ‚Üí Server) üì°
   Action: The AttackCommand object is serialized and sent over the WebSocket connection.

Performance: Dominated by network latency. The serialization of a tiny object is microseconds. The real "cost" is the time it takes for the data to travel to the server, which is the player's ping (e.g., 15-100ms).

3. Backend Processing (Server-Side) ‚öôÔ∏è
   Action: The server receives the command, retrieves the player and monster data, executes the combat logic, and determines the new state.

Performance: Microseconds to low milliseconds. This is where our architecture shines.

The State Service fetches the two ActorProfile records. If they are in a fast cache (like Redis), this is extremely quick.

The CombatService (our stateless "engine") performs the mathematical damage calculation. This is pure CPU work on small, in-memory objects and is blisteringly fast (microseconds).

The State Service receives the two new ActorProfile records and updates its cache. The write to the persistent database can happen asynchronously.

4. State Broadcast (Server ‚Üí Client) üì°
   Action: The backend publishes the StateUpdated event (containing the two new profiles) to Kafka.

Performance: Fast and decoupled. Publishing to Kafka is a very low-latency "fire-and-forget" operation for the server. The time for the message to travel through the broker and reach the client adds a few milliseconds of overhead but doesn't block the server.

5. UI Update (Client-Side) üñ•Ô∏è
   Action: Your JavaFX/Swing client receives the StateUpdated event. It updates the monster's HP bar and triggers a damage animation/number popup.

Performance: Extremely fast. Updating UI elements and starting an animation is a highly optimized operation in modern graphics pipelines. This brings us to your question about sprites.

Does Spritesheet Size Matter? Yes.
Yes, spritesheet size absolutely matters, but it's more about memory (VRAM) and GPU efficiency than raw processing speed.

A spritesheet is a "texture atlas." The reason we use them is that they are a massive performance optimization. Telling the GPU to switch which texture it's drawing from is a slow operation. By packing many individual sprites (like all the frames of a character's walk cycle) into one large image, the GPU can draw many different frames in a row without ever having to switch textures.

However, the size of that atlas matters for two reasons:

VRAM Usage: A larger texture (e.g., 4096x4096 pixels) uses significantly more of your graphics card's dedicated video RAM (VRAM) than a smaller one (e.g., 1024x1024). VRAM is a finite, high-speed resource. If your game uses too much VRAM, the system has to constantly swap textures between the much slower system RAM and VRAM, which is a major cause of stuttering and lag.

Initial Load Time: Larger image files take longer to load from the disk into memory when the game starts or a new map is loaded.

The Verdict: Using spritesheets is the correct, high-performance approach. The goal is to find a balance: pack related animations together to minimize texture switching, but don't make the spritesheets so enormous that they exhaust the VRAM of a typical user's machine.

Final Verdict
Stage	Typical Latency	Limiting Factor
1. Client Input	Nanoseconds	CPU Speed (Negligible)
2. Client ‚Üí Server	15-100ms	Network Ping
3. Server Processing	< 5ms	Caching / DB Speed
4. Server ‚Üí Client	15-100ms	Network Ping + Kafka
5. Client UI Update	< 1ms	GPU Fill Rate
